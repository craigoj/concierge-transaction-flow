# Design System & UX Enhancement Plan: "Vibe"

## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Goal:** To align our application's design with the principles of monday.com's "Vibe" design system.

**Why:** To create a more intuitive, visually appealing, and cohesive user experience that empowers our users and fosters a sense of clarity, speed, and delight.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Clarity:** Visuals and user experiences should be clear to instill confidence in users.
*   **Speed and Reliability:** The platform should be fast and dependable, giving users a sense of control.
*   **Intuitive Path:** Workflows are designed to be natural and help users achieve their goals easily.
*   **Delightful Experience:** The platform aims to empower users, making them want to continue using it.

## 2. Phase 1: Foundational UI Component Audit & Enhancement

**Objective:** Audit our existing `src/components/ui` library and align it with Vibe's foundational elements (colors, typography, spacing, icons).

**Action Items:**

*   **Color Palette:** Define a new color palette in `tailwind.config.ts` that reflects monday.com's branding.
*   **Typography:** Update our font styles and sizes to match Vibe's typography guidelines.
*   **Spacing & Layout:** Establish consistent spacing and layout rules based on Vibe's standards.
*   **Iconography:** Replace our existing icons with a set that aligns with Vibe's icon library.
*   **Component Refinement:** Refine our existing UI components (`button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, etc.) to match the look and feel of Vibe's components.

## 3. Phase 2: Implementing "Back" Functionality

**Objective:** Implement a consistent and intuitive "back" navigation system, similar to what a user might expect from a well-designed application.

**Action Items:**

*   **Navigation Analysis:** Analyze our current routing and navigation structure (`react-router-dom`).
*   **"Back" Button Component:** Create a reusable "Back" button component that can be easily integrated into various views.
*   **State Management:** Utilize `react-router-dom`'s `useNavigate` and `useLocation` hooks to manage navigation history effectively.
*   **User Experience:** Ensure the "back" functionality is predictable and doesn't lead to dead ends or unexpected behavior.

## 4. Phase 3: Page & View Redesigns

**Objective:** Redesign our key pages and views to align with the new Vibe-inspired design system.

**Action Items:**

*   **Prioritization:** Identify high-impact pages to redesign first (e.g., Dashboard, Transaction List, Settings).
*   **Layout & Composition:** Recompose pages using our enhanced UI components and the new design principles.
*   **Data Visualization:** Improve our data visualization components (`DashboardStats.tsx`, charts) to be clearer and more insightful.

## 5. Phase 4: Documentation & Component Library

**Objective:** Document our new design system and component library to ensure consistency and ease of use for developers.

**Action Items:**

*   **Storybook:** Create a Storybook to showcase our UI components and their various states.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** Write clear documentation for each component, including props, examples, and best practices.
*   **`design.md` Updates:** Keep the `design.md` file updated with our progress and any new design decisions.
