# Disaster Recovery Plan - Concierge Transaction Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the Concierge Transaction Flow application, ensuring business continuity in the event of system failures, data loss, or other catastrophic events.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

### Service Level Targets

| Component | RTO (Recovery Time) | RPO (Data Loss) | Priority |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Application Frontend | 15 minutes | 0 minutes | Critical |
| Database | 30 minutes | 5 minutes | Critical |
| File Storage | 1 hour | 15 minutes | High |
| Authentication | 15 minutes | 0 minutes | Critical |
| Edge Functions | 30 minutes | 0 minutes | Medium |

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Application Outage
**Cause**: Hosting provider failure, DNS issues, or major code deployment failure

**Impact**: 
- Users cannot access the application
- No new transactions can be created
- Existing data remains safe

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Immediate (0-5 minutes)**:
   - Check hosting provider status page
   - Verify DNS resolution
   - Check recent deployments

2. **Short-term (5-15 minutes)**:
   - Execute blue-green deployment rollback
   - Switch to backup hosting environment
   - Update DNS if necessary

3. **Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous deployment
   ./deployment/rollback.sh "Complete application outage"
   
   # Switch DNS to backup environment
   # (This would be done through your DNS provider)
   ```

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption or Loss
**Cause**: Database server failure, data corruption, accidental deletion

**Impact**:
- Application may be partially or completely non-functional
- Risk of data loss
- User authentication may fail

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Immediate (0-10 minutes)**:
   - Assess scope of database issues
   - Put application in maintenance mode
   - Stop all write operations

2. **Short-term (10-30 minutes)**:
   - Restore from latest backup
   - Verify data integrity
   - Resume operations gradually

3. **Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Restore database from backup
   supabase db reset --linked
   supabase db push
   
   # Verify data integrity
   supabase db test
   ```

### Scenario 3: Security Breach
**Cause**: Unauthorized access, data breach, malicious attack

**Impact**:
- Potential data exposure
- Service interruption
- Compliance violations

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Immediate (0-5 minutes)**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Revoke all API keys and tokens
   - Put application in maintenance mode

2. **Short-term (5-60 minutes)**:
   - Assess breach scope
   - Restore from clean backup
   - Update all credentials
   - Implement additional security measures

3. **Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Immediately revoke access
   # (Execute through Supabase dashboard)
   
   # Restore from backup
   ./deployment/backup-disaster-recovery.sh restore LATEST_CLEAN_BACKUP
   
   # Update environment variables
   # (Update through hosting provider dashboard)
   ```

### Scenario 4: Developer Environment Compromise
**Cause**: Local development environment compromise, stolen credentials

**Impact**:
- Potential unauthorized deployments
- Risk of malicious code injection
- Access to sensitive configuration

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Immediate (0-5 minutes)**:
   - Revoke compromised developer access
   - Review recent deployments
   - Check for unauthorized changes

2. **Short-term (5-30 minutes)**:
   - Audit all recent code changes
   - Reset all development credentials
   - Redeploy from verified clean state

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

#### Database Backups

- **Retention**: Last 10 deployments
- **Storage**: Git repository + deployment artifacts
- **Verification**: Automated checksums

#### Configuration Backups
- **Frequency**: Weekly or on configuration changes
- **Retention**: 60 days
- **Storage**: Encrypted archive in secure location
- **Verification**: Monthly restore tests

### Manual Backup Commands

```bash
# Create full backup
./deployment/backup-disaster-recovery.sh backup

# List available backups
./deployment/backup-disaster-recovery.sh list

# Verify backup integrity
./deployment/backup-disaster-recovery.sh verify TIMESTAMP

# Restore from backup
./deployment/backup-disaster-recovery.sh restore TIMESTAMP
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Step-by-Step Recovery Guide

#### 1. Incident Detection and Assessment
```bash
# Check application health
curl -f https://concierge-transaction-flow.com/health

# Check database connectivity
supabase db ping

# Check recent deployments
vercel ls --limit 5
```

#### 2. Incident Classification
- **P1**: Complete service outage
- **P2**: Partial service degradation
- **P3**: Minor functionality issues
- **P4**: Non-critical issues

#### 3. Recovery Execution

**For P1 Incidents (Complete Outage)**:
```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback
./deployment/rollback.sh "P1 incident - complete outage"

# 2. Verify rollback success
curl -f https://concierge-transaction-flow.com/health

# 3. If rollback fails, restore from backup
./deployment/backup-disaster-recovery.sh restore LATEST_BACKUP
```

**For P2 Incidents (Partial Degradation)**:
```bash
# 1. Identify affected components
# 2. Targeted component restart/rebuild
# 3. Monitor recovery progress
```

#### 4. Post-Recovery Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive health checks
npm run test:health-check

# Verify critical user flows
npm run test:critical-path

# Monitor error rates and performance
# (Check monitoring dashboard)
```
