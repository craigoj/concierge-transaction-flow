## Running Tests

### Unit and Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm run test validators.test.ts

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific browser
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium

# Run with UI mode
npm run test:e2e -- --ui

# Generate test report
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=html
```

### Accessibility Tests
```bash
# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Generate accessibility report
npm run test:a11y -- --reporter=html
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data
- Realistic test data for Hampton Roads market
- Comprehensive user personas and scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error scenarios and edge cases

### Test Utilities (`src/test/utils/testUtils.tsx`)
- Custom render function with providers
- Mock authentication contexts
- Reusable test data generators
- Helper functions for common test patterns

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Thresholds
- **Lines**: 70%
- **Functions**: 70%
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Statements**: 70%

### Priority Areas (90%+ Coverage)
- Form validation logic
- Security utilities
- Authentication flows
- Data sanitization functions

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
npm run prepare

# Run all checks before commit
npm run pre-commit
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Maintain test isolation

### Mocking Strategy
