# Testing Workflow: Claude Code Integrated Testing

This document outlines the comprehensive testing workflow for the Concierge Transaction Flow application using Claude Code's integrated testing infrastructure.

## 🎯 Overview

We use a **single-platform testing strategy** where:
- **Claude Code**: Complete development and testing environment with integrated CI/CD pipeline
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and E2E testing
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous monitoring and validation throughout development lifecycle

## 🔄 Testing Workflow

### 1. Development & Testing Phase

1. **Feature Development**: Build new features with integrated testing
2. **Continuous Testing**: Real-time test execution during development
3. **Quality Validation**: Comprehensive validation before deployment

### 2. Automated Testing Pipeline

#### Local Development Testing:

```bash
# Development with hot testing
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
npm run lint:watch       # Continuous linting

# Pre-commit validation
npm run test:all         # Complete test suite
npm run build            # Production build test
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript validation
```

#### Continuous Integration Testing:

```bash
# CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
# Triggers on: push, pull request, scheduled

# Test matrix execution:
- Unit Tests (Vitest)
- Integration Tests (Testing Library)
- E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Type Checking (TypeScript)
- Code Quality (ESLint/Prettier)
- Security Audit (npm audit)
- Performance Testing (Lighthouse)
- Accessibility Testing (axe-core)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Execution

Execute full testing suite:

```bash
# Complete test execution
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e         # End-to-end tests
npm run test:accessibility # Accessibility tests
npm run test:performance  # Performance benchmarks

# Quality assurance
npm run lint             # Code quality checks
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript validation
npm run security:audit   # Security vulnerability scan

# Build validation
npm run build            # Production build
npm run preview          # Production preview
```

### 4. Quality Assurance

#### Automated Quality Gates:
- ✅ All unit tests pass (70% coverage minimum)
- ✅ All E2E tests pass
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Security audit clean
- ✅ Build successful

#### Manual Quality Checks:
- 🔍 Visual regression review
- 🔍 Performance metrics acceptable
- 🔍 Accessibility standards met
- 🔍 Cross-browser compatibility

## 📊 Testing Structure

### Unit Tests (`src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`)
- **Coverage Target**: 70%
- **Framework**: Vitest + Testing Library
- **Mocking**: MSW for API calls
- **Focus**: Business logic, components, utilities

### E2E Tests (`testing/ui-documentation/tests/`)
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile
- **Focus**: Critical user flows, visual regression

### CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
- **Jobs**: Lint, TypeScript, Unit tests, E2E tests, Security audit
- **Artifacts**: Test reports, coverage reports

## 🔧 Development Commands
