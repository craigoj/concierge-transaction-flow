   - Remove any outdated or conflicting information
   - Verify all URLs and references are working

2. **Optimize for AI Consumption**
   - Use clear headings and structured formatting
   - Include specific examples and code snippets
   - Add context explanations for technical decisions

3. **Add Cross-References**
   - Link related concepts across documents
   - Reference specific files and components
   - Include database table relationships

### **Step 2: Knowledge Upload Process**

#### **Document Upload Checklist**

- [ ] **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- [ ] **Category**: Appropriate knowledge category
- [ ] **Tags**: Relevant tags for searchability
- [ ] **Description**: Brief summary of contents
- [ ] **Context**: How this relates to overall project

#### **Upload Order and Dependencies**

1. **Foundation Documents First**
   ```
   1. FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md (provides overall context)
   2. Database Schema (enables database-related development)
   3. CLAUDE.md (project overview and workflow)
   ```

2. **Implementation Guides Second**
   ```
   4. LOVABLE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md (specific implementation patterns)
   5. Component Examples (UI consistency)
   6. Brand Guidelines (visual standards)
   ```

   9. Technical assessments and optimization guides
   ```

### **Step 3: Knowledge Validation**

After uploading, validate knowledge effectiveness:

1. **Test AI Understanding**
   - Ask Lovable.dev to summarize project requirements
   - Request feature implementation based on uploaded knowledge
   - Verify AI can reference specific patterns and examples

2. **Check Cross-References**
   - Ensure AI can connect related concepts across documents
   - Verify database schema references work correctly
   - Test component pattern recognition

3. **Validate Completeness**
   - All major features documented
   - Technical patterns clearly explained
   - Business requirements fully captured

## üéØ Knowledge-Driven Development Workflow

### **Using Knowledge for Feature Development**

#### **Phase 2 Example: Offer Drafting Form**

**Prompt Template Using Knowledge:**
```
Based on the uploaded PHASE_2_PLANNING.md and LOVABLE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md knowledge:

Create a comprehensive offer drafting form that:
1. Follows the multi-section layout specified in Phase 2 planning
2. Uses the same validation patterns as the Agent Intake Form from Phase 1
3. Integrates with the offer_requests table as documented in the database schema
4. Maintains brand consistency per the uploaded brand guidelines
5. Includes mobile responsiveness matching existing components

Reference the uploaded examples and ensure consistency with established patterns.
```

#### **Knowledge Reference Patterns**

When requesting features, always reference uploaded knowledge:

- **"Based on uploaded database schema..."**
- **"Following patterns from Phase 1 components..."**
- **"Maintaining brand consistency per guidelines..."**
- **"Using validation patterns from existing forms..."**
- **"Integrating with automation rules as documented..."**

### **Continuous Knowledge Updates**

#### **When to Update Knowledge**
